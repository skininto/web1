    <h2>JavaScript</h2>


  Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

  As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

  Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.
